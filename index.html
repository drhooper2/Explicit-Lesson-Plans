                <h2>Indigenous Perspective in the B.C. Curriculum</h2>
                <p>The B.C. curriculum integrates Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives across all subjects through rationale statements, goals, big ideas, and learning standards. This fosters understanding of Indigenous peoples, supports reconciliation, and encourages meaningful discussions at all grade levels. The approach prioritizes B.C.-specific Indigenous knowledge and perspectives.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives in schools enriches all learners by promoting respect for diversity and cultural heritage, encouraging environmental stewardship and sustainability, and offering holistic approaches to problem-solving and learning. In British Columbia’s curriculum, these perspectives aim to foster reconciliation, deepen understanding of Indigenous peoples' contributions, and build respectful relationships.</p><br>

            <h2>First Peoples Principles of Learning</h2>
            <p>The <em>First Peoples Principles of Learning (FPPL)</em> were developed by Indigenous educators and knowledge keepers in British Columbia. They reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and teaching, and they guide educators in integrating Indigenous perspectives into learning environments. These principles emphasize the holistic, experiential, and relational aspects of learning.</p><br>

 <p>
     🌿 <strong>How do Indigenous Peoples know the  seasons are changing?</strong>
 </p>
 <ul type="disc">
     <li>
         <strong>Spring:</strong> Birds return,       plants grow, some
         Indigenous groups collect tree sap (maple or birch).
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Summer:</strong> Long days for       fishing, berry picking, and
         drying food for winter.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Fall:</strong> Salmon return to       rivers, and communities
         prepare for winter by gathering food.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Winter:</strong> Time for       storytelling, making tools, and
         resting.
     </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
     🐻 <strong>Connection to Animals:</strong> Ask,  “What do animals do in
     different seasons?” (E.g., bears hibernate, birds  migrate, frogs hide under
     mud.)
 </p>
 <p>
     🌱 <strong>Hands-on Activity: “What Happens in  This Season?”</strong>
 </p>
 <ul type="disc">
     <li>

         season).
     </li>
     <li>
         Provide       cut-out images of animals, plants, and activities.

 <!-- Adding Thompson Okanagan Info -->
 <p>
    Incorporating  Indigenous Knowledge specific to the Thompson Okanagan region
    into your primary  grades lesson plan on seasonal cycles can provide
    students with a deeper  understanding of local traditions and the natural
    world. This area is  traditionally inhabited by the Syilx (Okanagan),
    Nlaka'pamux, and Secwépemc  peoples.

</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>Class Discussion:</strong> Show pictures representing       the

    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            What do you see in each        picture? (e.g., snow-covered

    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            Spring: Pretend to pick        flowers or listen to returning birds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Summer: Act out swimming in        lakes or picking berries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fall: Imitate harvesting or        leaves falling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Winter: Pretend to build a        snow shelter or sit by a fire.

<p>
    <strong>3.  Seasonal Knowledge in Indigenous Cultures (30 min)</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>Spring:</strong> The return of birds and the       blooming of
        certain plants signal time for activities like root       harvesting.

    <li>
        <strong>Summer:</strong> Longer days are ideal for       fishing, berry
        picking, and drying foods for winter storage.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fall:</strong> Communities prepare for       winter by hunting
        and preserving meat, as well as gathering medicinal       plants.

        sections (one for each season), markers, and images or drawings       of
        local plants, animals, and activities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Activity:</strong> Students work together to       place images
        or drawings into the appropriate seasonal section, creating a
        visual representation of the Indigenous Seasonal Round—a cyclical
        understanding of seasonal activities and natural events.
