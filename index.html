                <h2>Indigenous Perspective in the B.C. Curriculum</h2>
                <p>The B.C. curriculum integrates Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives across all subjects through rationale statements, goals, big ideas, and learning standards. This fosters understanding of Indigenous peoples, supports reconciliation, and encourages meaningful discussions at all grade levels. The approach prioritizes B.C.-specific Indigenous knowledge and perspectives.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives in schools enriches all learners by promoting respect for diversity and cultural heritage, encouraging environmental stewardship and sustainability, and offering holistic approaches to problem-solving and learning. In British Columbia’s curriculum, these perspectives aim to foster reconciliation, deepen understanding of Indigenous peoples' contributions, and build respectful relationships.</p><br>

</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        Begin by acknowledging the       traditional territory where you are

        open the walk with a short reflection.
    </li>
    <li>
        Discuss the importance of       gratitude and respect for the land.

        As you walk, stop at       significant spots to discuss:
    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            <strong>Plants</strong>: Identify local plants and        discuss
            their traditional uses (e.g., cedar for purification, berries for
            food, or plants used in medicine).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Animals</strong>: Observe wildlife and        discuss their
            roles in Indigenous teachings (e.g., the salmon cycle, the

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Landforms</strong>: Talk about local rivers,

    <li>
        Ask guiding questions:
    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            What did you notice that        you hadn’t before?
        </li>
        <li>
            How do you think Indigenous        peoples have learned from this
            land for thousands of years?
        </li>
        <li>
            How can we show gratitude        for what nature provides?

 <ul type="disc">
     <li>
         <strong>Class Discussion:</strong> Show       pictures of the four
         seasons and ask:
     </li>
     <ul type="circle">
         <li>
             What        do you see in each picture? (Snow, leaves falling,
             flowers blooming,        etc.)
         </li>
         <li>
             What        do you wear in each season?
         </li>
         <li>
             What        fun things do you do in each season?

     </ul>
     <li>
         <strong>Movement Activity:</strong> Play       “Act Out the
         Season”—students move like falling leaves (fall), growing       plants
         (spring), shivering (winter), or swimming (summer).

     <strong>3. Seasonal Knowledge in Indigenous Cultures (30 min)</strong>
 </h3>
 <p>
     🌿 <strong>How do Indigenous Peoples know the  seasons are changing?</strong>
 </p>
 <ul type="disc">
     <li>
         <strong>Spring:</strong> Birds return,       plants grow, some
         Indigenous groups collect tree sap (maple or birch).
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Summer:</strong> Long days for       fishing, berry picking, and
         drying food for winter.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Fall:</strong> Salmon return to       rivers, and communities
         prepare for winter by gathering food.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Winter:</strong> Time for       storytelling, making tools, and
         resting.
     </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
     🐻 <strong>Connection to Animals:</strong> Ask,  “What do animals do in
     different seasons?” (E.g., bears hibernate, birds  migrate, frogs hide under
     mud.)
 </p>
 <p>
     🌱 <strong>Hands-on Activity: “What Happens in  This Season?”</strong>
 </p>
 <ul type="disc">
     <li>
         Use a       large chart divided into four sections (one for each
         season).
     </li>
     <li>
         Provide       cut-out images of animals, plants, and activities.
     </li>
     <li>
         Students       match images to the correct season based on Indigenous
         seasonal knowledge.
     </li>

         Take       students outside to look for
         <strong>
             clues       about the current season
         </strong>
         (e.g., leaves changing, birds       singing, colder air).
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Journaling Activity:</strong> Draw       or write about what
         they saw and how it shows the season is changing.

    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            What do you see in each        picture? (e.g., snow-covered

            Summer: Act out swimming in        lakes or picking berries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fall: Imitate harvesting or        leaves falling.
        </li>
        <li>
