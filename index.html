                <h2>Indigenous Perspective in the B.C. Curriculum</h2>
                <p>The B.C. curriculum integrates Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives across all subjects through rationale statements, goals, big ideas, and learning standards. This fosters understanding of Indigenous peoples, supports reconciliation, and encourages meaningful discussions at all grade levels. The approach prioritizes B.C.-specific Indigenous knowledge and perspectives.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives in schools enriches all learners by promoting respect for diversity and cultural heritage, encouraging environmental stewardship and sustainability, and offering holistic approaches to problem-solving and learning. In British Columbia’s curriculum, these perspectives aim to foster reconciliation, deepen understanding of Indigenous peoples' contributions, and build respectful relationships.</p><br>

            <h2>First Peoples Principles of Learning</h2>
            <p>The <em>First Peoples Principles of Learning (FPPL)</em> were developed by Indigenous educators and knowledge keepers in British Columbia. They reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and teaching, and they guide educators in integrating Indigenous perspectives into learning environments. These principles emphasize the holistic, experiential, and relational aspects of learning.</p><br>

     <strong>3. Seasonal Knowledge in Indigenous Cultures (30 min)</strong>

 <p>
     🌿 <strong>How do Indigenous Peoples know the  seasons are changing?</strong>
 </p>
 <ul type="disc">
     <li>
         <strong>Spring:</strong> Birds return,       plants grow, some
         Indigenous groups collect tree sap (maple or birch).
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Summer:</strong> Long days for       fishing, berry picking, and
         drying food for winter.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Fall:</strong> Salmon return to       rivers, and communities
         prepare for winter by gathering food.
     </li>
     <li>
         <strong>Winter:</strong> Time for       storytelling, making tools, and
         resting.
     </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
     🐻 <strong>Connection to Animals:</strong> Ask,  “What do animals do in
     different seasons?” (E.g., bears hibernate, birds  migrate, frogs hide under
     mud.)
 </p>
 <p>
     🌱 <strong>Hands-on Activity: “What Happens in  This Season?”</strong>
 </p>
 <ul type="disc">
     <li>
         Use a       large chart divided into four sections (one for each
         season).
     </li>
     <li>
         Provide       cut-out images of animals, plants, and activities.
     </li>
     <li>
         Students       match images to the correct season based on Indigenous
         seasonal knowledge.

         <strong>
             clues       about the current season
         </strong>
         (e.g., leaves changing, birds       singing, colder air).
     </li>

 <!-- Adding Thompson Okanagan Info -->
 <p>
    Incorporating  Indigenous Knowledge specific to the Thompson Okanagan region
    into your primary  grades lesson plan on seasonal cycles can provide
    students with a deeper  understanding of local traditions and the natural
    world. This area is  traditionally inhabited by the Syilx (Okanagan),
    Nlaka'pamux, and Secwépemc  peoples.

    <strong>3.  Seasonal Knowledge in Indigenous Cultures (30 min)</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">

        picking, and drying foods for winter storage.

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Activity:</strong> Students work together to       place images
        or drawings into the appropriate seasonal section, creating a
        visual representation of the Indigenous Seasonal Round—a cyclical
        understanding of seasonal activities and natural events.
