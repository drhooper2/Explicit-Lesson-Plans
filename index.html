                <h2>Indigenous Perspective in the B.C. Curriculum</h2>
                <p>The B.C. curriculum integrates Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives across all subjects through rationale statements, goals, big ideas, and learning standards. This fosters understanding of Indigenous peoples, supports reconciliation, and encourages meaningful discussions at all grade levels. The approach prioritizes B.C.-specific Indigenous knowledge and perspectives.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Perspectives in schools enriches all learners by promoting respect for diversity and cultural heritage, encouraging environmental stewardship and sustainability, and offering holistic approaches to problem-solving and learning. In British Columbia’s curriculum, these perspectives aim to foster reconciliation, deepen understanding of Indigenous peoples' contributions, and build respectful relationships.</p><br>

            <h2>First Peoples Principles of Learning</h2>
            <p>The <em>First Peoples Principles of Learning (FPPL)</em> were developed by Indigenous educators and knowledge keepers in British Columbia. They reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and teaching, and they guide educators in integrating Indigenous perspectives into learning environments. These principles emphasize the holistic, experiential, and relational aspects of learning.</p><br>

    <p>Teaching students about Indigenous connections to the land is essential for fostering respect, understanding, and reconciliation. Indigenous Peoples have deep-rooted relationships with the land, grounded in knowledge, traditions, and stewardship practices that have sustained their communities for generations. By learning about these connections, students gain a greater appreciation for the land's cultural, spiritual, and ecological significance, helping them develop a sense of responsibility toward the environment and a deeper respect for Indigenous worldviews and histories.</p>

<p>Teaching students about Indigenous storytelling is vital because it fosters respect for Indigenous cultures, histories, and worldview. These stories carry deep knowledge, life lessons, and connections to the land that has been passed down for generations. By engaging with Indigenous storytelling, students gain a broader understanding of diverse perspectives and develop empathy, cultural awareness, and a sense of belonging in a shared history. It also helps preserve these important traditions for future generations. </p>
